<p>Welcome to the lite version of my website. If you stumbled across this, I assume you've decided to check out my website with an old/text browser for some reason - you're pretty cool then I guess! Or, maybe you decided to check out the source code of my website and found that weird bit up the top... that's pretty cool too!</p>

<p>This is a personal portfolio site though, so I'll get on with the usual stuff.</p>


<h2>Blog</h2>

<p>Feel free to also check out <a href="/posts">my blog</a> - it should be mostly okay to view with old browsers, as the HTML/CSS is quite clean.</p>

<p>The latest post on there (sounds cool already right?) is:
{% for post in site.posts limit:1 %}
	<a href="{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a>
{% endfor %}</p>

<p>Maybe a <a href="/feed.xml">RSS feed</a> would be better suited for reading, though.</p>


<h2>Some Info</h2>

Hopefully these somewhat work on the browser you're on...

<ul>
	<li><a href="/about">About Me</a></li>
	<li><a href="/pc">My Computer Setups</a></li>
	<li><a href="/other-tech">Other Devices</a></li>
</ul>


<h2>My Links</h2>

Here are my links (although, they probably won't display properly with the browser you're on!):

<ul>
	<li>Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/_nexerq">@_nexerq</a></li>
	<li>GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/nicholastay">nicholastay</a></li>
	<li>LinkedIn: <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/nktay">nktay</a></li>
	<li>Email: nick -@- windblume dot net</li>
</ul>

<h2>You're awesome!</h2>

Thanks for visiting, and here's to more nice little webpages like this!
