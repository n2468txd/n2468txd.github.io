# About

Hey, I'm Nicholas Tay - but feel free to call me Nick.

Currently, I am a student at Monash University, working towards a double degree in Computer Science and Commerce (Finance). I enjoy messing with technology in my spare time, and always love to learn new things, particularly with software.

I guess that's about it for now, but I'll be trying to post more on [my blog](/posts) about things I mess with in my spare time, probably with regards to my homelab!
