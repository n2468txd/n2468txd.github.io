Hey, I'm Nicholas Tay -- but feel free to call me Nick.

Simply put: final year student at Monash University, working towards finishing a double Bachelor degree in Computer Science and Commerce (Finance major). I enjoy messing with technology in my spare time, and always love to learn new things, particularly with software.

Recently, I've been really into virtualisation, containerisation, and more within that space -- I'm still learning!

I guess that's about it for now, but I'll be trying to post more on [my blog](/posts) about things I mess with in my spare time, probably with regards to my homelab!

If you'd like to reach out to me about anything **business or security related**, please don't hesitate to contact me via **email** as on the sidebar to the left. For anything else, reach out to me on any **other platform** over there!
