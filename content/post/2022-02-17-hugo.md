I never really was satisfied with Jekyll -- I mean, the only reason I chose it as detailed in my [first post here](/2021/04/07/first-post/) was that I wanted something easy to deploy, something I could just push some Markdown to and the post would be styled how I wanted it. And when I wanted to redesign the website, it would be easy to!

Indeed, it was already quite easy, with GitHub Pages doing the heavy lifting. But as I was redesigning the page, as easy Jekyll was to use, it felt a bit slow and I just didn't feel like that was the last static site generator I would use. [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) seemed like a good choice, with it being written in Go and highly recommended around the web.

So once that was sorted, I needed a new host, since GitHub Pages only supported Jekyll (not sure if I could've used GitHub's CI, but anyway). Eventually, I landed on [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/). I already use Cloudflare for DNS, so I guess it made sense to just try it out. As a side bonus, they have a pretty cool subdomain if you don't already have a domain name, in the format `*.pages.dev` -- obviously I already have a domain name, but still pretty neat in my opinion anyway!

Once I had done the grunt work of learning the [Go templating syntax](https://gohugo.io/templates/) and fought with Hugo for a bit to port over the site just how I wanted it, I was good to deploy. Cloudflare Pages is able to directly hook into my GitHub repo and just build the website on each push to the `master` branch which is quite convenient. However, I came across a problem on the first build:

![Cloudflare Pages: Hugo build error on Hugo v0.54.0](/static/post-img/202202-cferror.jpg "Hugo build failed on the first try :({{< cc >}}")

Scrolling up revealed that it was running Hugo 0.54.0, and I noticed my local version was 0.88.1 -- so upon setting the `HUGO_VERSION` environment variable to `0.92.2`, the latest version, everything was fixed! Not sure why Cloudflare Pages defaults to an older version (maybe since a version after breaks older pages?), but apart from this one hurdle, it was really very easy to deploy!

Oh, and for a blog this small (only 6 posts at the time of writing), I think this command output sums up my gripes with Jekyll:

```
nick@angel:/d/Dev/personal-web » time hugo >/dev/null

real    0m0.202s
user    0m0.000s
sys     0m0.015s
nick@angel:/d/Dev/personal-web » git checkout 2022-jekyll
Switched to branch '2022-jekyll'
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/2022-jekyll'.
nick@angel:/d/Dev/personal-web » time bundle exec jekyll build >/dev/null

real    0m9.454s
user    0m0.000s
sys     0m0.031s
```

To be clear, Jekyll did report about 4 seconds to build the pages once it was actually generating (not including the time for Ruby `bundle` to start up). However, just for putting some HTML bits-and-pieces together, that is way too long!

Ruby also was a bit more of a pain to setup on Windows -- I know, why am I still here, but I think it's still worth mentioning. Hugo was really easy and lighter to setup, especially since I used Chocolatey. While building the website, Hugo also came with hot-reloading out-of-the-box with the `hugo serve` server, which was a very welcome surprise.

I'm quite happy with the results so far, let's see how it works out in the long run!
