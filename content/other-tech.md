## Game consoles

Yeah, there's probably not much point getting other consoles as I just prefer PC anyway... you can probably spot a pattern. Honestly I don't think I played some of these that much, but anyway.

- Nintendo Wii (family console, ~2009)
	- Softmodded with RiiConnect24 installed
	- Favourite(s): Wii Sports, New Super Mario Bros Galaxy 2, Mario Kart Wii
- Nintendo 3DS (acquired secondhand, ~2018)
	- Softmodded with Luma3DS in use
	- Favourite(s): Pokemon X, Pokemon Alpha Sapphire, Picross 3D: Round 2
	- (Haven't really played much else, I got it mainly for Pokemon...)
- Nintendo Switch (family console, ~2019)
	- Favourite(s): Mario Kart 8 Deluxe
	- (Have Pokemon Shield but honestly disappointing)
