At the moment, I frequently use a desktop, 2 laptops and a 'server' (of sorts). I'll list them based on the hostnames I gave them... there's a story behind each of them usually, but I'll keep them to myself :)

With regards to the laptops, I primarily use the X230.

- SSD: 120GB

Other details:

	- 2022 update: for some reason the fans spin up so dang often, and it frequently just chugs along... :(
	- Maybe I'll try reverting to High Sierra to see if it works better some time.


## Servers

### bubble

Acer Chromebox CXI2

- CPU: Intel Celeron 3205U
- RAM: 4GB
- SSD: 16GB
- HDD(USB3): Seagate Expansion Desktop 4TB

Other details

- OS: Debian 10 buster
- My main homelab server in use - small, low power box I can have in the corner plugged in to the main router
- Honestly powerful enough for everything I need, but the storage (USB3) is janky and internal storage is very little, so I need to offload things to the USB drive (which sucks)


## Older systems

These aren't in active use anymore, but I might use them from time to time.
