I enjoy messing with technology, especially a good challenge to learn new things, particularly with software.

By day, I'm a Trading Engineer at IMC Trading, Sydney.

Academically, I graduated from Monash University in 2022 with the Bachelors of Computer Science and Commerce (Finance major).

In my free time, I really enjoy listening to [some music](https://www.last.fm/user/nexerq), messing with various bits of interesting software, and play some video games -- at the moment, it happens to be Genshin Impact ([profile](https://webstatic-sea.mihoyo.com/app/community-game-records-sea/index.html?user_id=19309289#/ys)). {{< rawhtml >}}<span style="color: transparent;">(keqing #1 :D)</span>{{< /rawhtml >}}

I guess that's about it for now, but with those interesting software bits, I'll be trying to post more on [my blog](/posts) about them!
