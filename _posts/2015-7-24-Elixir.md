It's been a while since I got this blog up and running. And now here's another post.

I've been quietly working away at contributing to [michaelowens/xikbot](https://github.com/michaelowens/xikbot), which is an IRC bot which is connects to twitch. It is written in [Elixir](http://elixir-lang.org/), which was completely new to me. I have no experience in Erlang or anything similar really.

Elixir has been a fun language to work in, with all the interesting syntax, for example the |> which is like a pipe in the command line. I haven't seen similar in other languages and I have been stuck with nesting things in brackets constantly, which has been very messy.

I'm working on a module to grab the uptime and store it in a database with [elixir-lang/ecto](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ecto). I have never worked with any databases really, and I'm still trying to get my head around it. In this case I have been experimenting with PostgreSQL.

Anyway I should stop this post here, maybe I'll post soon... soonâ„¢ :P.
