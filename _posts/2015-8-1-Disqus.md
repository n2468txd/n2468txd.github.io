So it is a day after my birthday, and I, once again, had nothing much to do so I am writing this blog post and adding some random stuff, like I have just added Disqus comment integration to the site. I still have in mind more plans as to theming and such, as the current 'theme' is still very 'vanilla' Jekyll. I however do like this clean feel and do not mind just staying on it, as themes may mean longer loading times and more load on the client

I still want to have fun theming and playing around with the Liquid syntax of stuff, I have been playing around with that as `_config.yml` can store all of my config and this makes it easy to migrate if I need to switch over to some other URL (easy for the blog, not so easy on the Disqus end however, need to play around with migration in that case haha). Anyway just writing as a log that I added Disqus today, feel free to comment if you want (not expecting anyone to be reading lol).

As a side note I am still thinking of a way to implement timestamps into these posts, however I probably will just need to sort that out manually.
