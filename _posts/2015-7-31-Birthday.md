title: Birthday! (and other stuff)
---

As always, it feels like a long time since my last post. Anyways it is my birthday today, and I have updated the Jekyll site template.

So today I had nothing much to do, and decided to build the Jekyll site from scratch instead of running it off a fork of [barryclark/jekyll-now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now). It is now off a template of the stock 'jekyll new site', and I really like it so far. Don't get me wrong, I will slowly customize it more soon. Disqus support will be coming soon! I have also migrated all the stuff from my old site already.
