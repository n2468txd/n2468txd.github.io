Hey guys, just got Jekyll running on my GitHub pages and scrapped the old page.

This feels like a really good way to create webpages and it's fast and free of (many) scripts unlike WordPress. First I was going to use WordPress but that couldn't link my domain and it had a very heavy interface. This gives me a nice way to edit directly in Markdown and is still very easy to edit, as I already know some Markdown myself.

At the moment, I enjoy playing osu!, and also I changed my name over to Nexerq. I have been getting tired of my old name with numbers, and this is a nicer, one word name. Most of my old services will still have my old name, the ones which I could be bothered to change will be changed. n2468txd is still my 'legacy' name and I like it in some regard, so I am going to be keeping it on some services, like GitHub here.

Stay tuned for more updates :)
(I may not be updating this that frequently though heh)
