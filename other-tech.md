# Other Tech

{% include toc.md %}

Other bits and pieces of technology I have. May or may not use them often.

## Phones

### Current phone

Samsung Galaxy Note 10 Aura Glow 256GB (acquired Nov 2019)

- Earphones: Samsung Galaxy Buds White

### Previous phones

There's a bit of a trend here... until I decided I wanted a change.

- LG V20 H990DS Titan 64GB (acquired Jan 2018)
	- Still working, have it as a spare dual-sim phone for testing!
- LG G3 D855 Gold 32GB (acquired Dec 2015)
	- Weird screen fade to black behaviour especially when phone hot...
- LG Nexus 4 16GB (acquired Aug 2013)
	- Dropped and cracked it :( now touch doesn't work


## Game consoles

Yeah, there's probably not much point getting other consoles as I just prefer PC anyway... you can probably spot a pattern. Honestly I don't think I played some of these that much, but anyway.

- Nintendo Wii (family console, ~2009)
	- Softmodded with RiiConnect24 installed
	- Favourite(s): Wii Sports, New Super Mario Bros Galaxy 2, Mario Kart Wii
- Nintendo 3DS (acquired secondhand, ~2018)
	- Softmodded with Luma3DS in use
	- Favourite(s): Pokemon X, Pokemon Alpha Sapphire, Picross 3D: Round 2
	- (Haven't really played much else, I got it mainly for Pokemon...)
- Nintendo Switch (family console, ~2019)
	- Favourite(s): Mario Kart 8 Deluxe
	- (Have Pokemon Shield but honestly disappointing)
